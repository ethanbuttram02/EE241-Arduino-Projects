# EE241-Arduino-Projects
This is where I will showcase and store my Arduino projects in EE241 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo

First is a modification of the CapSensePiano project by user tylercrumpton which can be found here: https://www.instructables.com/Capacitive-Touch-Arduino-Keyboard-Piano/
  My use case is to send a 5V signal to a relay which sends 9V to a circuit strobing a light at about 1Hz, which will flash onto a photoresistor, activating a solenoid that will push a 
  metal ball into a metal detector, which will turn off an electromagnet holding another metal ball that will fall into a salt shaker and season a printed jpg of a Porterhouse steak, Gary 
  Perks' favourite cut of steak!

This project taught me a lot about researching code and signals. It incredibly strengthened my knowledge of the Arduino platform, its Coding language and IDE. As well as more hands-on learning brought to you by Cal Poly "Learn by Doing".

This code is free to the public and all permission is granted to use with credit in the comments of your file. Any decent coding professor will allow this because code is free, all I advise is you give this a try yourself before copy-pasting my files because its easier than it seems.
