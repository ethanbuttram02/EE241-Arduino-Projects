# EE241-Arduino-Projects
This is where I will showcase and store my Arduino projects in EE241 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo

First is a modification of the CapSensePiano project by user tylercrumpton which can be found here: https://www.instructables.com/Capacitive-Touch-Arduino-Keyboard-Piano/
  My use case is to turn on an LED, and later suppply voltage to a relay by detecting a sequence of key presses on the physical keyboard made from tin foil, electrical tape,
  and the back of a CocaCola Box. More specific credit is commented inside the Arduino CapSensePiano.ino file.
